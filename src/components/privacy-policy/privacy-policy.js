        circumstances, you may request that we stop processing some or all of

            Data Portability. You have the right to receive a copy of your
            personal data in a machine-readable (electronic) format and to have
            it sent to another service provider, if our legal basis for

        interests, rights and freedoms or where we need to process such data for
        the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

          <li>
            You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on
            automated processing (i.e., decisions made by machines without human
            involvement), including profiling, which would produce legal effects
            or similarly affect you significantly. Our processing of your data
            does not involve this type of automated decision-making.
          </li>
          <li>
            Withdraw consent. Where we rely on your consent to process your
            personal data for a particular purpose, you may withdraw your
            consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, we will stop
            processing your personal data for the specific purpose or purposes
            requested. This does not affect the lawfulness of processing of your
            data before you have revoked the consent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Register a complaint. If you reside in applicable jurisdictions, you
            are entitled, per local data protection law, to contact your local
            authorities regarding any question, concern or complaint you have
            relating to our processing of your personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-discrimination. You have the right to not be discriminated
            against if you exercise any of your privacy rights. We will not
            discriminate against you or deny, charge different prices for, or
            provide a different quality of our Services if you choose to
            exercise these rights, although some functionality and features on
            the Services may change or no longer be available to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can request to exercise any of your privacy rights with an email
            to hello@sabel.club. Please note that when you make a request to
            exercise your rights, we may require that you provide information
            and follow procedures so that we can verify your identity. Where
            possible, we will attempt to match the information that you provide
            in your request to information we already have to verify your
            identity. If we are able to verify your request, we will process it.
            We will assess any request to exercise these rights on a
            case-by-case basis. We will respond to your request within the
            periods required by applicable data protection law. However, we may
            not always be able to comply fully with your request, and we will
            notify you in that event.
